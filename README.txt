Preface
1. In this submission for my Assignment 3 is the java file of my code and this readme file.
2. The java file is necessary for the execution of the code.

Guide
1. Download and save the java file in any a directory of your choice
2. Open terminal window and open the directory where the java file is saved as follows: cd path1\path2\...\...\folderName
4. Compile the java file as follows: javac TernaryTree.java
5. Create or add a .txt input file to the same directory where java file is located. Input file should contain the desired commands, with one command per line.
6. Run the program with arguments for the input and output as follows: java TernaryTree InputFileName.txt OutputFileName.txt
7. An output file will produce the output text corresponding to the commands in the input file. If the file already existed it'll override it, otherwise it creates the file.
8. Done. Can go back to step 6 to run the program again.
